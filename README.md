If you have any questions, don't fucking contact me. Try to find your answer here:


1. Does this even work?

To my surprise, yes it's actually working wtf lol

1. Why does this website look so bad?

Because I don't know frontend. I dont even know CSS properly so this web site looks like shit. I will be learning frontend in a few days so yeah.

2. Is making a chat bot difficult? It looks like this project required no skill whatsoever.

You are right, making a chat bot is the easiest shit ever that's why I have made it in the first place lol.

3. Why do you sound so frustrated?

Because I spent 17 hours of my time trying to find an error and later realised that I wrote 'sent' instead of '/sent'

4. You look like a great developer? Will you work for me?

No.

Please ignore the last question. I'm so lonely
